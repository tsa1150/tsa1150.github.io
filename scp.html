            <p class="contentCardStuff">No diet or meal is complete without protein and per our vegetarian lifestyle and values, we supplement regular meat with alternative sources of a carnivore’s pallet. All our traditional meat including dishes such as Chinese Style “Spareribs” are made with instead Tofu or tempeh made from soybeans undergoing different sustainable practices.  As it is one of the most common ingredients, we had to ensure that we had chosen a mindful source of soybeans for soybeans. Ken Phan Farm has been in business for over 20 years and has cultivated its growing practices to a T. The farm runs 7 days a week-ensuring the freshest soybeans, uses no pesticides, and uses no chemical fertilizers, reducing their carbon footprint.  </p>

            <p class="contentCardStuff"> We send chefs and grocers on Sundays and Wednesdays from 7 A.M. to 5 P.M. to the city's heart to collect all our fresh produce.  The Heart of the City Market is located at 1182 Market ST. #415, and only a 20-minute walk from our location in downtown SF. 
Additionally, it is the only non-profit market in the city only contributed to by the small farms of San Francisco such as Bungcayou Farm which supplies traditional organic Asian ingredients such as snake beans and Sichuan peppercorns both included in our crunchy and yummy Sichuan Style Stir-Fried Chinese Long Beans.</p>

                    <h3>No Fertilizers, No GMO, No Way!</h3>
                    <p>Artificial fertilizers have been popular in the agriculture industry for what seems like forever to produce crops faster and more abundantly.  Unfortunately, negative environmental impacts such as water pollution, habitat destruction, and soil erosion are almost synonymous with ” Chemical fertilizers “. Never fear! The Lotus Lab has ensured that all our local organic ingredient suppliers such as Ken Phan Farms and Miramonte Farm Organics utilize exactly 0 artificial fertilizers. Not only does it guarantee added nutrients to the ground, no overuse of water, and safe environments for the harmless and helpful critters, we 100% know it makes the food tastier!</p>

                    <p>To support local businesses and lessen carbon emissions, 100% of our ingredients and resources are from less than 15 miles outside the city! Unlike most restaurants, we’ve never sent a big bulk truck emoting harmful fumes to gather sources. We only buy from small farms and farmer’s markets, so we can also handpick our produce, and protein every time! </p>

                    <h3>Made In House= Better</h3>
                    <p>Tofu and tempeh are the #1 protein source at the Lotus Lab, so we’ve made sure they are made both deliciously AND responsibly. Tofu is made with soybean and is then made to be soy milk and allowed to curdle and cut into blocks. Tempeh is made by boiling and fermenting soybeans. We utilize thermogalvanic fridges in which cooling happens through a series of reversible electrochemical reactions to produce electricity without getting near the traditional high temperature of regular fridges. Additionally, our stoves are electric which emits x3 less carbon dioxide than other industrial gas stoves and systems. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All grains and fruits such as cantaloupe and watermelon grown in our in-house garden are produced through dry farming which means we don’t irrigate during dry seasons that California so commonly goes through. This leads to conserving watering and not allowing an excess of waste in our production of goods. </p>
